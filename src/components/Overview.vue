          Upgrade started on October 29, 2020, as C19 Creative Marketing Solutions offering only three types of services which are Graphic Designs, Printing Services, and Video Editing. On December 03, 2020, we registered and decided to change our name to Upgrade Digital Marketing Services and became a one-stop-shop marketing and IT solutions company. In March 2021, as a global strategy of the company, we expand the business in the USA.
